python3 net1.py

This will automatically show the plot for the neural network.

To change the training data you need to manually change the train_set variable in the program.


To run the X^2 neural net you need to run the following command
python net2b.py

This will automatically show the plot for this neural network

To change training data you need to change the generate set function or just set the train set variable to a static value
